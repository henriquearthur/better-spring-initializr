Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting this milestone:

- Preserve v1 visual identity; refine usability and reliability without redesign.
- Keep Spring Initializr BFF contracts and deterministic URL/localStorage state model.
- Keep preset behavior as dependency-only apply (no metadata/build overwrite).
- Keep GitHub OAuth publish path, but move auth behind explicit publish intent.
- Focus v1.0.1 on readability, guidance clarity, output flow sequencing, and preview stability.
