# Requirements Archive: v1.0 MVP

**Archived:** 2026-02-14
**Status:** SHIPPED

## Outcome Summary

- v1 requirement scope shipped across Phases 1-7.
- One requirement was adjusted during acceptance: PRST-02 finalized as dependency-only preset apply (no metadata/build overrides).
- v2 enhancements remain intentionally deferred.

## v1 Requirements (Final)

### Configuration
- [x] **CONF-01**: User can set project metadata (group, artifact, name, description, package name)
- [x] **CONF-02**: User can select Java version from available options
- [x] **CONF-03**: User can select Spring Boot version from available versions
- [x] **CONF-04**: User can choose build tool (Maven or Gradle)
- [x] **CONF-05**: User can choose language (Java or Kotlin)
- [x] **CONF-06**: User can choose packaging (JAR or WAR)

### Dependencies
- [x] **DEPS-01**: User can browse dependencies organized by category (Web, Data, Security, etc.)
- [x] **DEPS-02**: User can search dependencies by name or description
- [x] **DEPS-03**: User sees dependency cards with name, description, and category tags
- [x] **DEPS-04**: User can toggle dependencies on/off with visual feedback
- [x] **DEPS-05**: User can see selected dependency count and clear all

### Preview
- [x] **PREV-01**: User sees live file tree of the generated project in the main area
- [x] **PREV-02**: User can click any file in the tree to view its contents with syntax highlighting
- [x] **PREV-03**: User sees file tree and contents update in real-time as config changes
- [x] **PREV-04**: User sees diff highlighting when toggling dependencies (what changed)

### Output
- [x] **OUTP-01**: User can download generated project as ZIP
- [x] **OUTP-02**: User can share current configuration via URL (shareable link)
- [x] **OUTP-03**: User can push generated project to a new GitHub repository via OAuth

### Presets
- [x] **PRST-01**: User can browse curated presets (e.g., "REST API + Postgres + Docker")
- [x] **PRST-02**: User can apply a preset to update dependency selection (adjusted from original metadata+dependency auto-fill)
- [x] **PRST-03**: User can see what a preset includes before applying it

### Layout & UI
- [x] **LAYO-01**: App opens directly into workspace -- no landing page
- [x] **LAYO-02**: Left sidebar contains all configuration sections (collapsible)
- [x] **LAYO-03**: Main area shows live preview (file tree + file viewer)
- [x] **LAYO-04**: User can toggle dark/light theme
- [x] **LAYO-05**: User's last configuration persists across browser sessions via local storage

### Infrastructure
- [x] **INFR-01**: BFF proxy via TanStack Start server functions wrapping Spring Initializr API
- [x] **INFR-02**: API metadata (dependencies, versions) cached to avoid excessive upstream calls
- [x] **INFR-03**: GitHub OAuth flow handled securely via server functions

## Deferred (Future Milestones)

The following remain deferred to post-v1 milestones:
- ENHC-01..08 (community presets/import, compatibility insights, keyboard shortcuts, generated README, broader exports/responsiveness improvements)
