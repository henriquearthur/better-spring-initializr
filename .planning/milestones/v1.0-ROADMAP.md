# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-14
**Phases:** 1-7
**Total Plans:** 14

## Overview

v1.0 delivered a complete Spring Boot project generation workspace on top of Spring Initializr. The milestone shipped direct-to-workspace UX, BFF metadata and preview pipelines, project configuration controls, dependency browsing, live preview with diffs, ZIP/share outputs, GitHub push integration, and curated dependency presets.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Workspace Shell

**Goal:** Developers see a polished workspace UI immediately on load, backed by a working BFF proxy that serves Spring Initializr metadata.
**Depends on:** Nothing (first phase)
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-foundation-workspace-shell-01-PLAN.md - TanStack Start setup, direct workspace shell, and dark/light theme toggle
- [x] 01-foundation-workspace-shell-02-PLAN.md - Spring Initializr metadata BFF server functions with TTL caching and workspace integration

### Phase 2: Project Configuration

**Goal:** Users can fully configure a Spring Boot project's metadata and build settings through an intuitive sidebar.
**Depends on:** Phase 1
**Plans:** 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-project-configuration-01-PLAN.md - Build collapsible configuration sidebar with all metadata/build controls
- [x] 02-project-configuration-02-PLAN.md - Add nuqs URL state sync and localStorage persistence for project config
- [x] 02-project-configuration-03-PLAN.md - Gap closure: mount nuqs adapter and re-verify URL/localStorage runtime behavior

### Phase 3: Dependency Browser

**Goal:** Users can discover, search, and select dependencies through an intuitive visual interface.
**Depends on:** Phase 2
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-dependency-browser-01-PLAN.md - Categorized dependency browser with search, cards, toggle selection, and clear-all controls
- [x] 03-dependency-browser-02-PLAN.md - Gap closure: align must-have key-link wiring to parent-owned dependency hook architecture

### Phase 4: Live Preview

**Goal:** Users see exactly what their configured project looks like before generating it, with real-time feedback on every change.
**Depends on:** Phase 3
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-live-preview-01-PLAN.md - BFF preview snapshot pipeline with virtualized file tree rendering
- [x] 04-live-preview-02-PLAN.md - Syntax-highlighted file viewer and dependency-change diff integration

### Phase 5: Generation & Sharing

**Goal:** Users can download their configured project and share their configuration with others.
**Depends on:** Phase 4
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 05-generation-sharing-01-PLAN.md - BFF ZIP generation contract and Initializr download server function
- [x] 05-generation-sharing-02-PLAN.md - Workspace download/share actions with URL restore wiring

### Phase 6: GitHub Integration

**Goal:** Users can push their generated project directly to a new GitHub repository without leaving the tool.
**Depends on:** Phase 5
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 06-github-integration-01-PLAN.md - GitHub OAuth flow with secure server-side token session management and workspace connect UX
- [x] 06-github-integration-02-PLAN.md - Repository owner selection and create-plus-push pipeline for generated project output

### Phase 7: Curated Presets

**Goal:** Users can jumpstart project setup by browsing and applying curated presets for common use cases.
**Depends on:** Phase 2
**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 07-curated-presets-01-PLAN.md - Curated preset catalog, includes preview, and apply-to-workspace wiring

Outcome note: preset apply behavior was finalized as dependency-selection-only (no project metadata/build overrides), based on post-implementation user feedback.

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Keep TanStack Start as the single frontend+BFF platform.
- Proxy Spring Initializr API through server functions with sanitized contracts.
- Use URL/localStorage state as canonical project configuration persistence path.
- Implement share links as versioned encoded snapshots.
- Keep curated presets as static in-repo definitions and apply dependencies only.

**Issues Resolved:**
- Restored nuqs adapter mounting to satisfy runtime URL state behavior.
- Aligned dependency-browser must-have documentation with actual parent-owned hook wiring.
- Resolved client build/runtime edge cases from node builtin imports by scoping polyfills to non-SSR resolution.

**Issues Deferred:**
- Community/custom presets and import flow deferred to future milestone.
- Advanced compatibility intelligence and migration guidance deferred to future milestone.

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- Existing repository still contains unrelated workspace changes that should be cleaned up in normal feature-flow commits.
